# NYC_311_Data_Analysis

This project explores data on 311 service requests in New York City. The 311 number is one that constituents can call to request city services. It is intended to be an alternative to the 911 number, where constituents report emergencies.
The analysis focuses on requests from the year 2015 that were assigned to the New York Police Department. It uses python and pandas to explore the data for trends that could be used by the city to help improve their services. 

Questions to be addressed include:
* Are there trends by season? By month? By hour of the day?
* What about geographic trends (i.e. trends by borough)?
* How long, on average, does it take to close a request? Does that vary by borough? By complaint type?
* Are there any trends with how these service requests are resolved?
